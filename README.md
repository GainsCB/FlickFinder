<p id="description">FlickFinder is a web application designed to help users quickly and easily find a movie or TV show to watch. Users can choose between movies and TV shows and the app will randomly select a title from a pre-defined list. Additionally, users can manage their library of movies and shows adding new titles as desired.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here are some of the project's best features:

*   Random Flick Selection: Users can select either "Movie" or "Show" and then click "Find me a Flick" to receive a randomly chosen title from the corresponding category. This feature is designed to provide viewing recommendations quickly.
*   Categorization: The app differentiates between movies and TV shows allowing users to focus their search. The "Movie" and "Show" buttons toggle between highlighted and unhighlighted states to indicate the selected category.
*   Library Management: Users can add movies and TV shows to their library. This library is displayed on a separate page and lists movies and shows separately.
*   Add to Library: A dedicated "Add to Library" section allows users to input the name of a movie or show and add it to their respective list. The "Movie" and "Show" buttons in this section also toggle to specify which list the new entry should be added to.
*   Modal/Pop-up Sections: The "Flick Found" "Library" and "Add to Library" sections are implemented as modal/pop-up windows that overlay the main content. This keeps the main screen uncluttered and provides a focused experience for each function. Close buttons (X) are provided on each of these modals.
